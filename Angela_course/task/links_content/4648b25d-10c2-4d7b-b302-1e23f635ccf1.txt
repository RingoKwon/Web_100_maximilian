However the distribution of rewards of a block is only performed once the block reaches a certain maturity. In other words, the rewards are paid only after a  fixed number of blocks have confirmed a block. With the exception of the first blocks in the blockchain after genesis, every time a block is added to the blockchain, another previous block reaches maturity and its rewards are paid.Previous2.6Security ChainNext3.1Implementation GuideMoreReport an IssueJoin the CommunityChangelogFeedbackShareCopy page linkCopy page linkBack to topBuildTogetherWHITEPAPEROriginal WhitepaperUpdated WhitepaperRIF WhitepaperRESOURCESMerged MiningRootstock ExplorerAbout RootstockLabsBlogÂ© 2024.
