1. If your node is not in localhost, connect your computer to the node over ssh.
ssh user@server
2. Pick a network that you would like to connect to.
Regtest​
In order to switch from another network to Regtest:
sudo service rsk stopcd /etc/rsksudo rm -f node.confsudo ln -s regtest.conf node.confsudo service rsk start
Using this network, it allows you to start with some wallets (accounts) on your node. These wallets have funds.
Testnet​
In order to switch from another network to Testnet:
sudo service rsk stopcd /etc/rsksudo rm -f node.confsudo ln -s testnet.conf node.confsudo service rsk start
For Mainnet​
In order to switch from another network to Mainnet:
sudo service rsk stopcd /etc/rsksudo rm -f node.confsudo ln -s mainnet.conf node.confsudo service rsk start
By running these instructions in your shell, you are:

Stopping the running RSK service.
Moving to RSK configuration folder (cd).
Removing node.conf, that is a symbolic link to the configuration you're using (rm deletes it).
Linking node.conf with the configuration file you decide (ls with the -s option, it makes symbolic - or soft - links). The node is configured to read directly from the node.conf link.
Restarting the RSK service.
