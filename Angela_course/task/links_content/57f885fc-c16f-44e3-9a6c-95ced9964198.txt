Notice: Name Change to PowPeg AppEffective September 03rd, 2024, the 2 Way Peg App has been officially renamed to PowPeg App, this name change reflects Rootstock's commitment to providing a more intuitive and engaging experience for users.Note that the previous address still works, redirecting users to the new one.The app is available at https://powpeg.rootstock.io/If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact support.

To get started, see the prerequisites section.

The PowPeg App converts BTC to RBTC and vice versa. It is secured by the PowPeg protocol, which is a unique protocol that secures the locked bitcoins with the same Bitcoin hashrate that establishes consensus.
It is a web application that fosters the interaction between the bitcoin blockchain and the Rootstock network for easier exchange of BTC and RBTC. It also provides a way to visualize the status of transactions, communicate with a user wallet (both hardware wallets and software wallets), while also providing the highest possible level of security for transactions.
How it Works​
The PowPeg App uses a REST API and a PowPeg api as the backend, this API uses a daemon process, which is responsible for listening on blockchain transactions to update the state of peg-ins and in the future, the state of peg-outs, these state changes (tx hash, date change, last status) are stored in a mongodb database.
InfoThe PowPeg App is available on both Mainnet and Testnet.
The source code is available on github, and open source:

Visualization of transactions

Enables the visualization of the status of transactions on the Rootstock network

Enables communication with a user wallet (hardware and software)

The PowPeg App communicates directly with the following services:

Trezor: Directly via USB
Ledger: Directly via USB and integrated with the manufacturer's application
Metamask: Through the rLogin application. Learn more about the rLogin application


Secure transactions

All transactions need to be confirmed via the device used by the customer, whether a hardware or software wallet, all transaction information and the appropriate signatures are generated through integration with the wallets.
