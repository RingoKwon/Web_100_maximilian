Transferred tokens from Ethereum, and after 24 hours have not received tokens on Rootstock​
Network: ETH to Rootstock
When: Current Block - Transaction Block Number < 5760
Answer: 24 hours is an approximation, it is not fixed. Wait until 5760 blocks have past since the transaction block number, plus 5 minutes.
Transferred tokens from Ethereum, and after 24 hours have not received tokens on Rootstock​
Network: ETH to Rootstock
When: Current Block - Transaction Block Number > 5760
Answer:  Look in the Rootstock Explorer at the SAME ADDRESS on Rootstock. If you do not see the correct balance in the tokens tab, please share your Transaction Hash in the #token-bridge channel on Rootstock Discord (go to Discord Community to join.

Transferred tokens from Ethereum to Rootstock, but do not see them in my wallet​
Network: ETH to Rootstock
When: always
Answer:  Rootstock has a different derivation path (m/44’/137’/0’/0) from Ethereum (m/44’/60’/0’/0). Software wwallets respects this convention. Copy your mnemonic or private key and use Metamask and add Rootstock as custom network, to get the same address as ethereum.

Why does it take 24 hours? Can it be faster?​
Network: Both
When: always
Answer:  This is for security measures. 24 hours is an approximation, it is not exact. We are working to reduce this time in the next version.
Why can't I choose the address?​
Network: Both
When: always
Answer:  Currently, it uses the token bridge always sends tokens to the same address on the other blockchain network, and so the sender and the receiver will always have the same address. You will have the option to send to another address in the next version.
Metamask threw an error​
Network: ETH
When: always
Answer:  This is usually a timeout as the Transaction was not mined on the time expected by Metamask. This does not mean that transaction has not been mined. Please share your Transaction Hash in the #token-bridge channel on Rootstock Discord (go to Discord Community to join).
I don't see my transaction on the Token Bridge list​
Network: N/A
When: always
Answer:  The list is stored in the local cache, so it’s not shared across devices, and it's erased if you clear your browser cookies and temporary files. You can be sure that if the transaction is mined the tokens will cross no matter what the list says. If this is not the reason why it is not there please let us know in the #token-bridge channel on Rootstock Discord (go to Discord Community to join).
I used the Sovryn Token Bridge​
Network: N/A
When: always
If you have used bridge.sovryn.app,
note that this is not the same as the Rootstock Token Bridge.
To get support, please ask on the
Sovryn discord group.
I sent Rootstock tokens to an Ethereum address​
Network: N/A
When: always
Note that if you have tokens on the Rootstock network, such as RIF or USDRIF,
including "crossed" tokens such as rUSDT or rDAI,
you should not send them to an Ethereum address in a regular transaction.
This does not work!
Instead, you should use the Rootstock Token Bridge to cross the tokens
from one blockchain to the other.
If you have done this already,
and sent the tokens to an address that is not under your control -
where you do not have the private key or the seed phrase -
then you have burnt the tokens, and they are not recoverable.
If you have done this already,
and sent the tokens to an address that is not under your control -
where you do have the private key or the seed phrase -
then it may be possible to recover your tokens.
I have multiple wallets installed, but i'm only given one option​
Network: N/A
When: always
Decentralised apps on websites, such as the Rootstock Token Bridge,
interact with the blockchain network through a standard interface
known as a web3 provider.
Each browser wallet attempts to "inject" a web3 provider as soon as it is loaded.
This means that if you have multiple browser extensions doing the same thing,
one of them will override the other(s).
In order to avoid this problem, and if you already have multiple wallets installed,
is to choose which wallet you wish to use, and disable the other ones.
To do this in in Chrome, enter chrome://extensions/ in your address bar,
which brings you to a settings screen that lists all of
the browser extensions that you have installed.
Click on the toggle button to disable all of the browser extensions
that inject web3 providers, except for the one that you wish to use.
