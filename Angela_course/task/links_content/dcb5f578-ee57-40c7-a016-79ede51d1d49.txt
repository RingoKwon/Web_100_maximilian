HTTP Transport Protocol
Websockets Transport Protocol

HTTP transport protocol​
HTTP requests should be made:

to the port number specified in the config for rpc.providers.web.http.port

this is 4444 by default
for public nodes, omit the port number


to the "root" route (/)
using the HTTP verb POST
specifying a Content-Type header of application/json
with a request body specified as stringified JSON

For example, a curl command to a localhost Rootstock node
would look similar to this:
curl http://localhost:4444/ \ \  -X POST \  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"RPC_METHOD_NAME","params":[RPC_REQUEST_PARAMETERS],"id":1}'
WebSockets transport protocol​
WebSockets connections should be established:

to the port number specified in the config for rpc.providers.web.ws.port

this is 4445 by default
public nodes do not have the WebSockets transport protocol enabled


to the WebSockets route (/websocket)

Once connected:

Send a request body specified as stringified JSON
No "verb" or "headers" are necessary, as these are specific to the HTTP transport protocol

For example, a wscat command to connect to a localhost Rootstock node
would look similar to this:
wscat -c ws://localhost:4445/websocket
After the connection has been established using wscat,
you may send multiple RPC requests within the same session.
(Note that >  marks requests to be input,
and that <  marks responses that will be printed.)
