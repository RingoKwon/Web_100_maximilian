Using the PowPeg AppIn this guide, we will use the PowPeg App - Testnet for learning purposes.
Note that for transactions using real tokens, use the PowPeg App - Mainnet.

The Bitcoin testnet app does not show on Ledger live manager by default. To be able to see the BTC Testnet app you need to enable the developer mode in Ledger live.

Enable Developer Mode for Bitcoin Testnet

Connect your ledger hardware device and unlock it.
Open Ledger live, click on Manager and open settings.
Navigate to the experimental features menu and enable developer mode. This will show developer and testnet apps in the manager.


Go to Ledger live manager and search for Bitcoin testnet app
Click on install to install the Bitcoin Testnet application. To use the testnet app you also need the main Bitcoin app. So install both the apps to your device.




Get Testnet address

On your ledger device, you’ll find all the apps installed on your device. The Bitcoin app to be used on Mainnet, and Bitcoin Test app to be used on Testnet. To start using testnet, we need the testnet address, to get this address:

Open the Bitcoin test app on your ledger device. You will see a “Bitcoin Testnet is ready” screen
In the ledger live app, go to accounts tab, click on add account.


Search testnet and select Bitcoin Testnet (BTC). Click on Continue


Approve the Bitcoin Test app on your hardware wallet device
On the next screen choose the address format (Native SegWit / SegWit).
Click on Add Account:




Note: See supported addresses for the types of addresses supported by the PowPeg App.


You have successfully added the Bitcoin testnet app to your account.







Get Funds​

Copy BTC Testnet address


Use the following faucet to receive testnet tokens:

Open Coinfaucet
Paste the address into the field and click on Get Bitcoins.




Note: You need at least 0.005 BTC to perform a peg-in on Mainnet and Testnet. Likewise, you need at least 0.004 RBTC to perform a peg-out on Mainnet and Testnet.


Get Mainnet Tokens

InfoThe PowPeg App is available on both Mainnet and Testnet. Both applications follow the same process. For production purposes, use Mainnet, for testing and development purposes, use the Testnet.
