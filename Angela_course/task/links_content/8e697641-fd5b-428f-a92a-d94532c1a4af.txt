Limitations​
MetaMask does not yet fully comply with the technical specifications
of account based addresses on Rootstock.
Note that there are workarounds available,
which allow most users to use MetaMask on Rootstock successfully.
MetaMask uses the Ethereum value for derivation path,
and presently does not allow it to be configured.
This means that if you use the same seed phrase in MetaMask and other wallets,
you will get a different set of addresses.
A workaround for this is to use custom derivation paths
when using other wallets that support this feature.
MetaMask does not presently support EIP-1191 checksums.
This means that if you use the addresses copied from MetaMask,
you may encounter checksum validation errors.
A workaround for this is to lowercase the addresses after copying them.
Disclaimer
Currency may be mistakenly displayed as ETH within some screens of MetaMask.
The Rootstock network uses RBTC as its cryptocurrency.
This tutorial uses the Public Nodes as RPC. You can connect to other nodes or use the Rootstock RPC API.
The node must enable CORS for browser-based dApps to work.

Please review the configuration file reference for CORS settings.
