Rootstock combines Ethereum's flexibility with Bitcoin's security and scalability, offering a compelling environment for dApp development.
With Rootstock, you can bridge the gap between Ethereum and Bitcoin, bringing your existing Ethereum dApps to the Rootstock platform.
This guide will walk you through porting your Ethereum dApp to the Rootstock network using the Hardhat Ignition deployment tool and leveraging the compatibility between Solidity (used for Rootstock) and Ethereum.
Advantages of Porting Your dApp to Rootstock‚Äã
1. Faster Transaction Speeds
Rootstock performs transactions by merge-mining with Bitcoin. This means that Rootstock transactions benefit from the security of the Bitcoin network while achieving faster confirmation times compared to Ethereum.
2. Lower Gas Fees
Rootstock‚Äôs gas fees are typically lower than Ethereum, averaging around $0.052. This cost-effectiveness can be especially appealing for dApps that require frequent interactions with the blockchain.
3. Leveraging Bitcoin Security
Rootstock is a layer 2 on Bitcoin, which means it inherits the security of the Bitcoin network. This security model provides confidence to builders and users.
Similarities Between Ethereum and Rootstock‚Äã
1. Solidity as the Programming Language
Both Ethereum and Rootstock use Solidity as their primary smart contract programming language. If you‚Äôre already familiar with Solidity, transitioning to Rootstock should be relatively straightforward.
2. EVM Compatibility
Rootstock is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility allows developers to reuse existing Ethereum smart contracts on Rootstock with minimal modifications.
Key Differences Between Ethereum and Rootstock‚Äã
1.Consensus Mechanisms
Ethereum currently uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, while Rootstock employs a hybrid PoW/PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus. Rootstock‚Äôs PoS component enhances scalability and energy efficiency.
2. Token Standards
While Ethereum introduced popular token standards like ERC20 (fungible tokens) and ERC721 (non-fungible tokens), Rootstock has its own token standard called RRC20. Understanding the differences between these standards is crucial when porting tokens.
3. Network Fees
As mentioned earlier, Rootstock generally offers lower gas fees. Developers can take advantage of this cost savings when deploying and interacting with smart contracts.

Configure Rootstock Networks: By now, your hardhat project should have four main artifacts besides the basic Node configuration:

contracts/
ignition/modules/
test/
hardhat.config.js




This guide uses Hardhat version 2.22.5. For this version, the default tool for managing deployments is Hardhat Ignition.


Install Hardhat Ignition and TypeScript

  npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition-ethers typescript
At this point, your hardhat.config.ts should look like this:
  import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";  import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";  import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition-ethers";  const config: HardhatUserConfig = {    solidity: "0.8.24",};export default config;
Configure Rootstock Networks‚Äã
To configure the Rootstock networks, you'll need an RPC URL for both mainnet and testnet and a Private Key of the account that will deploy the contracts.
To get the RPCs, go to the RPC API dashboard from Rootstock Labs create an account if you don't have one, and get an API key for Rootstock testnet or Rootstock mainnet.
Mainnet RPC URL should look similar to this:Testnet RPC URL should look similar to this:https://rpc.mainnet.rootstock.io/<API-KEY>https://rpc.testnet.rootstock.io/<API-KEY>
The next step is to retrieve your private key. If you don't know how to get the private key to your wallet, here's a tutorial on Metamask.
Also, if you haven't added Rootstock mainnet or testnet to your Metamask Wallet, you can do it by clicking the Add Rootstock or Add Rootstock Testnet buttons in the footer of mainnet explorer or testnet explorer.
Store the RPC URLs and the Private Key‚Äã
To securely store the RPC URLs, you can use a .env file or the Hardhat configuration variables. For this example, you'll use the second option.
To store this, type in the terminal in the project's root folder:
npx hardhat vars set TESTNET_RPC_URL
And enter the value after pressing enter.
noteMake sure your TESTNET_RPC_URL value is in this format: https://rpc.testnet.rootstock.io/API-KEYFor example, https://rpc.testnet.rootstock.io/eOQAoxAI7Bt6zZ6blwOdMjQQIzKwSW-W (Where eOQAoxAI7Bt6zZ6blwOdMjQQIzKwSW-W is your API-KEY)
npx hardhat vars set TESTNET_RPC_URL‚úî Enter value: ¬∑ ****************************************************************
Now repeat this step for your MAINNET_RPC_URL.
You‚Äôll see output similar to this:
The configuration variable has been stored in /Users/wisdomnwokocha/Library/Preferences/hardhat-nodejs/vars.json
For the Private key:
When requested to enter your private key, press enter it.
npx hardhat vars set PRIVATE_KEY‚úî Enter value: ¬∑ ****************************************************************
You‚Äôll see output similar to this:
The configuration variable has been stored in /Users/wisdomnwokocha/Library/Preferences/hardhat-nodejs/vars.json
Now, update your hardhat.config.ts file to include Rootstock network configurations. Here‚Äôs an example of how it should look:
import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition-ethers";const config: HardhatUserConfig = {  solidity: "0.8.24", // Set your desired Solidity version  networks: {    // Mainnet configuration    mainnet: {      url: "https://rpc.mainnet.rootstock.io/<API-KEY>",      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],    },    // Testnet configuration    testnet: {      url: "https://rpc.testnet.rootstock.io/<API-KEY>",      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],    },  },};export default config;
Replace <API-KEY> with your actual API keys obtained from the Rootstock Labs dashboard. Also, store your private key securely (e.g., in a .env file).
Copy Ethereum Contract Code and Tests‚Äã
Copy this Ethereum contract and its tests to your Rootstock Hardhat project. Place it inside the contracts folder so the route would be contracts/SimpleStorage.sol.
SimpleStorage.sol‚Äã
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MITpragma solidity ^0.8.24;contract SimpleStorage {    uint256 public favoriteNumber;    function store(uint256 _favoriteNumber) public {        favoriteNumber = _favoriteNumber;    }}
Copy this test code and create a new file named SimpleStorage.ts inside the test folder. The route will be test/SimpleStorage.ts.
Update SimpleStorage.ts‚Äã
import { loadFixture } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox/network-helpers";import { expect } from "chai";import hre from "hardhat";describe("SimpleStorage", function () {  async function deploySimpleStorageFixture() {    const [owner] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();    const SimpleStorage = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("SimpleStorage");    const simpleStorage = await SimpleStorage.deploy();    return { simpleStorage, owner };  }  describe("Deployment", function () {    it("Should deploy and initialize favoriteNumber to 0", async function () {      const { simpleStorage } = await loadFixture(deploySimpleStorageFixture);      expect(await simpleStorage.favoriteNumber()).to.equal(0);    });  });  describe("Store", function () {    it("Should store the value 42 and retrieve it", async function () {      const { simpleStorage } = await loadFixture(deploySimpleStorageFixture);      const storeTx = await simpleStorage.store(42);      await storeTx.wait();      expect(await simpleStorage.favoriteNumber()).to.equal(42);    });    it("Should store a different value and retrieve it", async function () {      const { simpleStorage } = await loadFixture(deploySimpleStorageFixture);      const storeTx = await simpleStorage.store(123);      await storeTx.wait();      expect(await simpleStorage.favoriteNumber()).to.equal(123);    });  });});
Compile Your Contract‚Äã
To compile your contract, run this command in your terminal:
npx hardhat compile
After compilation, you‚Äôll see output similar to this:
Generating typings for: 1 artifacts in dir: typechain-types for target: ethers-v6Successfully generated 6 typings!Compiled 1 Solidity file successfully (evm target: paris).
Test Your Contract‚Äã
To test your contract functionality, run this command in your terminal:
npx hardhat test
The test results will show whether your contract behaves as expected. You should see something like this:
SimpleStorage    Deployment      ‚úî Should deploy and initialize favoriteNumber to 0    Store      ‚úî Should store the value 42 and retrieve it      ‚úî Should store a different value and retrieve it  3 passing (286ms)
Deploying Your Contract on Rootstock Testnet‚Äã
1. Ensure Sufficient Balance
Before deploying, ensure you have enough testnet tokens (RBTC) in your wallet. If not, obtain some from the Rootstock faucet.
2. Create the Deployment Script
Create a file named SimpleStorage.ts inside the ignition/modules folder. Paste the following TypeScript code into that file:
import { buildModule } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules";const SimpleStorageModule = buildModule("SimpleStorageModule", (m) => {  const simpleStorage = m.contract("SimpleStorage");  return { simpleStorage };});export default SimpleStorageModule;
3. Deploy the Contract
In your terminal, run the deployment command:
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/SimpleStorage.ts --network rskTestnet
This TypeScript script uses Hardhat Ignition to deploy the SimpleStorage contract in a declarative way.
4. Confirmation and Deployment

Confirm the deployment to the Rootstock testnet by typing ‚Äúyes.‚Äù
Hardhat Ignition will resume the existing deployment (if any) and execute the deployment process.
You‚Äôll see a success message indicating that the contract was deployed.

InfoIf you get an error like IgnitionError: IGN401, try running the command again.

If you want to deploy your contract on mainnet, change rskTestnet to rskMainnet in the last command and make sure you have RBTC available in your wallet.

Verify Deployment‚Äã
Visit Rootstock Testnet Explorer. Paste your contract address (0x3570c42943697702bA582B1ae3093A15D8bc2115) into the search bar to verify successful deployment.
