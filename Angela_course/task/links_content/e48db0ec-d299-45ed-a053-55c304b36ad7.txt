2. Update jar file​
Note that PREVIOUS and NEW refer to version numbers.
cd /usr/share/rsksudo service rsk stopsudo mv rsk.jar rsk-PREVIOUS.jarsudo mv rskj-core-NEW-all.jar rsk.jar
3. Clean up log directory​
This step is optional.
sudo mkdir /var/log/rsk/PREVIOUS/sudo mv /var/log/rsk/rsk* /var/log/rsk/PREVIOUS/sudo service rsk start
4. Validate service is running normally​
Check logs:
tail -f /var/log/rsk/rsk.log
Check that Blockchain is moving forward, and adding blocks:
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber", "params": {},  "id":123}' http://127.0.0.1:4444 | jq .result | tr -d '"' | awk '{print "printf \"%d\\n\" "$0}' | sh
If you run this command a few times and the block number is increasing,
it means it is syncing correctly too.Tags:rskrskjnodeupdateversionrootstockPrevious6.1Network UpgradesNext7.0TroubleshootingLast updated on Nov 7, 2024 by Owanate AmachreeOn this page1.
