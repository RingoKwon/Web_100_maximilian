Service Level Agreement (SLA)​
RootstockLabs aims to meet the following SLAs for hackers participating in our program:

Time to first response (from report submit) - 5 business days
Time to triage (from report submit) - 7 business days
Time to bounty (from triage) - 15 business days

We aim to keep you informed about the progress throughout the process.
Disclosure Policy​

Follow HackerOne's disclosure guidelines.
Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a bounty. If the user reports the vulnerability to other security teams (e.g. Ethereum or ETC) but reports to RootstockLabs with considerable delay, then RootstockLabs may reduce or cancel the bounty.
